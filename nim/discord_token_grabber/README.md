# Discord Token Grabber

A discord token grabber witten in nim's standard library that works on both Linux and Windows.

### Compilation
Needs to be compiled with `-d:ssl` for ssl support.

### Notes
Hiding the cmd window from appearing from [nim-lang forum](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/7320) and compiled with `--app:gui`

The self destruct function only works on Linux, but can probably be implemented on Windows with winim and [self_delete_bin.nim](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/self_delete_bin.nim)
