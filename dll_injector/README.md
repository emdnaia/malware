# DLL Injector

This malware will read an AES encrypted DLL stored in favicon.ico, decrypt it, and store the dll to `C:\Users\Public\maliciousDLL.dll`. Once stored, the malware will search for a running process of notepad.exe and attempt to inject the dll into it.
`maleware.cpp` acts as a dropper and an injector; `maliciousDLL.cpp` creates the dll. 
There is very little obfuscation done to try to bypass anti-virus scans and the dll is easily caught by windows defender
