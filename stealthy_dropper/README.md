# Stealthy Dropper

Capstone project for Red Team Operator Malware Development Essentials course. 
This malware will read in AES encrypted shellcode from favicon.ico, decrypt it with a hardcoded AESkey, and inject the payload into explorer.exe.
All strings are encrypted using AES, each with their own unique hardcoded key. Most function calls are obfuscated.

`create_favicon.py` is used to AES encrypt shellcode and store it into favicon.ico. A random key is used and printed out.

`obfustation.py` is used to generate obfuscated function calls for the malware
